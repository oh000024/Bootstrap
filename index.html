				<h2>An uncertain future</h2>
				<p>Polar bears are not threatened because of other animals or because they are being hunted too much. Polar bears are threatened as a direct effect on how we as humans treat the earth and the environment. People have begun to take the Earth for granted. They have treated it as thought it is indestructible. When if fact, the earth is destructible, and we are destroying it. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Disappearing habitat</h2>
				<p>Polar bears live in a very specific habitat. They need the cold, snow and ice of the polar regions. That is why they are called "polar bears" and not "summer bears." Human-caused global warming is causing the Arctic sea, the bears' habitat and hunting ground, to melt and decline. If the trend of sea ice decline continues as it has done, at the rate of about 13 per cent a decade, then polar bears would suffer a loss of habitat, and consequently food. The bears simply depend on sea ice to make a living, Derocher says. "No sea ice means no seals. And no seals means no polar bears." </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h2>Climate change</h2>
				<p>In reality, any argument about polar bear extinction reveals itself as being more about climate change than the extinction of the bears themselves. "The polar bear is the fuzzy face of climate change," Amstrup says. "So a lot of people who don't believe that global warming is occurring, or deny that it is going to be a problem, like to cherry pick different things about polar bears, because if they can make it look like polar bears will be OK then by proxy they are kind of saying 'we don't have to worry about global warming'."</p>
